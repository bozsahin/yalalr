yet another LALR parser generator interface

This is going to be an interface to <a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/code/lalrparser.lisp">Mark Johnson's LALR parser generator</a>.

What it does:

1. returns unknown tokens as ID, so the lexicon is open-ended.
2. provides a standard workflow for writing syntax-directed LR translation and code generation.

soon.
